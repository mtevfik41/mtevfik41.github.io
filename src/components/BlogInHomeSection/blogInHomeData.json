    "blogDescription": "What I've learned in 3 months of web development",
    "blogContent1": "First of all, it wasn't easy, but it wasn't hard either.When I interviewed for erasmus earlier in the year before working hard, a hard truth hit me in the face. The interviewer asked me if you have any projects you have done. But I only had theoretical knowledge. After a few negative job interviews, I realized that I needed to plan a career.",
    "blogContent2": "So I basically started to work after this situtation. I look around the web development ecosystem, and there are all these new frameworks which I have never heard of before.\nThere is way too much to learn, so I decided to just stick with frontend stuff at first. I was recommended React and I thought it was a pretty good idea because knowledge in React directly transferred over to React Native, so I could tackle web, Android, and iOS all at once.\nAfter going through the some tutorials, I realized that the way that React forms Apps out of these Components is pretty cool, and it felt like the object-oriented nature of Java applied to the JavaScript I was using before on my webpages.\nAnd after all, I made a personal page finally and I wrote this blog write to publish on my website.",
    "blogContent3": "As for my thoughts, I like React. But it's not just about React. There are lots of helpful javascript and css libraries to learn. But I don't want to get hung up on the front-end. After some more practice with React, I'll start working on the back-end with spring boot. And that's actually the important part for me, Backend. I'm excited about this, but all the bricks must fall into place before I begin.",
